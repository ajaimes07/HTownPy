                                                 Proposal
1.   	Title: Open Data for the City of Houston
2.   	Motivation. Despite the City of Houston open data website has listed 250 datasets available to the public, these datasets are outdated and most of the URLs are disable.
3.   	Goal. Create a database of selected updated data sets for the city of Houston
Methods.
1.       Find data
Each member of our team selected a dataset from different websites that focus on schools, Texas commission of environmental quality, and ____.  
2.       Clean-up and analysis
In some cases, the data sources include data for the state of Texas, we are cleaning the data by selecting only the field pertinent to the city of Houston.
Our primary key is City of Houston, zip code, or county.
