                                             Open Data for the City of Houston

MOTIVATION. 
The open data website of the City of Houston has listed aproximately 250 datasets available to the public. 
Most of these datasets are outdated our URLs are disabled. Our goal is to create a database of selected updated data sets 
for the city of Houston

METHODS.
a. Each member of our team selected a dataset from different websites that focused on public schools, Texas commission of environmental quality, and ____. 

URLs 
1. http://data.houstontx.gov/dataset/public-schools-in-the-houston-region/resource/04da3864-8f59-4b0f-8611-1542b1584d6f
2. https://www17.tceq.texas.gov/tamis/index.cfm?fuseaction=report.site_list
3. 

b. Because most of the data sources included state/national wide information, the data cleaning process consisted of droping columns of data that did not correspond to the city of Houston. 
c. We explored both methods to export data into a database MongoDB and SQL. On a SQL database, our primary key is City of Houston, and Foreing Key street address, or county.

RESULTS

Our final results are contained in a repository called HTownPy.
